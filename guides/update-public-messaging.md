# Update Public Messaging

A document to consult every time any public messaging is modified for Pulsar.

Due to Pulsar's large presence on the web, it became necessary to ensure changes against this messaging in a single place, results in reviews or checks in every single place. This ensures any and all changes fit our character, as well as the story they are experiencing.

## Steps:

When any piece of public messaging needs to be updated, here are a few key steps to ensure things go smoothly.

1. Take into account our official tagline: `A Community-led Hyper-Hackable Text Editor`
2. If necessary take into account our de-facto farewell: `... see you amongst the stars!`
3. Avoid temporary language, as it may quickly become outdated.
4. Ensure the Pulsar Team agrees with the language proposed.
5. Take into consideration the language used throughout other public messaging. (Listed Below)
6. Once done, take the time to consider if other public messaging needs to be updated. (Listed Below)
