# Collection of Archived Repositories

Many of the repositories inherited from Atom upstream, are no longer in use, or in some cases were never in use, or not in use in Pulsar.

We want to keep these available for historical reasons but otherwise will be archived. The following is a list of all packages affected by this philosophy.
